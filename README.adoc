*Message Generation* and *Greeter* are example applications demonstrating the use of Service Registry for Pivotal Cloud Foundry. (For information on the Service Registry product, please https://docs.pivotal.io/spring-cloud-services/service-registry/[see the documentation].)

The main branch is using `spring-boot 3.0.0` and `spring-cloud 2022.0.0`. Check https://github.com/spring-cloud-services-samples/greeting/tree/spring-boot-2.7[spring-boot-2.7] branch for older versions.

== Building and Deploying

. Build the two projects from the root (`greeting`) directory. If using Maven, run:
+
....
$ mvn package
....
+
If using Gradle, run `./gradlew build` (OS X, Linux) or `gradlew.bat build` (Windows).
+
....
$ ./gradlew build
....

. Run the deployment script (if you used Maven, link:scripts/deploy_mvn.sh[`scripts/deploy_mvn.sh`] or link:scripts/deploy_mvn.bat[`scripts/deploy_mvn.bat`]; if you used Gradle, link:scripts/deploy_gradle.sh[`scripts/deploy_gradle.sh`] or link:scripts/deploy_gradle.bat[`scripts/deploy_gradle.bat`]).
+
....
$ ./scripts/deploy_gradle.sh
....
+
The script will create a Service Registry service instance and then push the applications and bind them to the service.


[NOTE]
====
By default, the Spring Cloud Services Starters for Service Registry causes all application endpoints to be secured by HTTP Basic authentication. For more information or if you wish to disable this, https://docs.pivotal.io/spring-cloud-services/service-registry/writing-client-applications.html#disable-http-basic-auth[see the documentation]. (HTTP Basic authentication is disabled in these sample applications.)

== Trying It Out

. Visit `[ROUTE]/hello`, where `[ROUTE]` is the route bound to the Greeter application. The Greeter application will use the Service Registry to look up the Message Generation application and get a greeting message, which (to begin with) should be &#8220;Hello, Bob!&#8221;

. You can see what the Message Generation application is sending back by viewing its logs. Run `cf logs greeter-messages`.
+
....
$ cf logs greeter-messages

. To get a different greeting message, you can provide `salutation` and `name` parameters, as in `[ROUTE]/hello?salutation=Hi&name=John`. The Greeter application will send those parameters to the Message Generation application and the resulting greeting will be customized to match.
